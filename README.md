# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. The Case study provides a financial risk analysis service enabling the lending club to properly decide on accepting or rejecting loan applications, and guide for proper interest rate to be applied for accepted applications.

The analysis is based on historical data of old loans that are either fully paid, or defaulted. Current loans are excluded from the analysis as they can't considered as defaulted)
* [Technologies_Used](#The Analysis uses Python, Pandas, numpy, and plot to manipulate, analyse and visualize the data and the risk probability of Defaulting.)
* [Conclusions](#The Analysis provides the Lending Club with a clear vision of all parameters and their effects on default)
* [Acknowledgements](#We would like to acknowledge and give our warmest thanks to the upgrad team who made this work possible. We would also like to thank all the learners and other teams who also worked hard to deliver this case study. We have read some brilliant comments, notes, and suggestions on teh chat groups that opened our eyes on areas that was not clear for us, thanks to you.

We would also like to give special thanks to our families as a whole for their continuous support and understanding when undertaking this research and delivering this project. Sorry for being too busy and away during this project. Your prayer for me was what sustained us this far.

Finally, I would like to thank God, for letting me through all the difficulties. I have experienced your guidance day by day, hour by hour, and task by task. I will keep on trusting you for my future.)
